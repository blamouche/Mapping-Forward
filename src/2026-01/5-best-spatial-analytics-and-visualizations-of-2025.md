## Elevator pitch

CARTO presents five key spatial analytics approaches that defined 2025, from risk management using space-time anomaly detection to the emergence of Agentic GIS that democratizes geospatial analysis through natural language interfaces.

## Takeaways

- Space-time anomaly detection enables proactive risk management by identifying significant event clusters across geography and time
- Automated data pipelines connecting workflows to visualization tools eliminate manual intervention for real-time operations monitoring
- Site and network optimization now evaluates location decisions holistically, considering customer demand, service capacity, and competitive landscape simultaneously
- Automated territory balancing tools ensure fair workload distribution and operational efficiency across geographic regions
- Agentic GIS with natural language interfaces democratizes spatial analysis, allowing non-technical users to query geospatial data conversationally

## Synthesis

CARTO's retrospective on 2025's most impactful spatial analytics approaches reveals a significant shift toward accessibility and automation in geospatial intelligence. The article identifies five distinct use cases that organizations have increasingly adopted to leverage location data for strategic advantage.

Risk management has evolved to incorporate historical pattern analysis through space-time anomaly detection. This technique identifies clusters of significant events across both geographic and temporal dimensions, enabling organizations to move from reactive to proactive strategies. Applications span from predicting crime wave patterns to managing insurance liabilities, with the ability to surface anomalies that would be invisible through traditional analysis methods.

Operations management has been transformed by real-time insights delivered through automated data pipelines. By connecting CARTO Workflows to Builder, organizations can maintain continuously-updated maps that reflect evolving conditions. This automation proves particularly valuable for weather alert monitoring, fleet management, and service disruption tracking, where manual updates would create dangerous delays in decision-making.

Site and network optimization represents a more holistic approach to location decisions. Rather than evaluating potential sites in isolation, organizations now consider the full context of customer demand patterns, existing service capacity, and competitive positioning. This integrated view is especially valuable for telecommunications providers planning network expansion, retailers optimizing store footprints, and financial services firms managing branch networks.

Territory planning has benefited from automated balancing and allocation tools that divide geographic areas into optimized regions based on business metrics. This ensures equitable workload distribution across sales territories, service areas, and operational zones while maintaining efficiency targets.

Perhaps the most transformative development is Agentic GIS, representing the democratization of spatial analysis through conversational AI. These AI agents, embedded within dashboards, enable non-technical users to query spatial data using natural language. The system translates these queries into proper geospatial operations, with workflows designed by GIS experts ensuring accuracy and reliability. This marks a fundamental shift in who can access and benefit from location intelligence within an organization.

The overarching theme of 2025 is clear: spatial analysis has moved beyond the exclusive domain of GIS specialists to become a company-wide capability through automation, AI integration, and cloud-native platforms.
