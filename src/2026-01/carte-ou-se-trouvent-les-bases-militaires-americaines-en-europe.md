## Elevator pitch

An interactive map and analysis of the approximately 50 American military bases across Europe, hosting 67,000 to 105,000 troops, examining their strategic importance, geographic distribution, and the ongoing debate about defense burden-sharing.

## Takeaways

- Germany hosts the largest concentration of US troops in Europe with over 35,000 personnel, followed by Italy (12,375) and the UK (10,058)
- Approximately 67,000 active-duty US military personnel were deployed across NATO's 30 member countries in 2024, representing about 40% of all overseas US forces
- Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, troop numbers have fluctuated between 75,000 and 105,000 according to the Council on Foreign Relations
- US bases in Europe serve critical functions: deterring aggression, enabling rapid response to crises, and supporting allied nations
- France remains the notable exception, having expelled US and Canadian forces in 1966 under de Gaulle, a situation unchanged even after NATO reintegration in 2007

## Synthesis

This comprehensive article from Toute l'Europe provides both a cartographic visualization and detailed analysis of American military infrastructure across the European continent. The piece situates the current military presence within its historical context while addressing contemporary political debates about transatlantic defense relationships.

The American military footprint in Europe traces its origins to the immediate post-World War II period. These installations were established with dual objectives: preventing another large-scale European conflict and containing Soviet expansion during the Cold War. Despite the end of that era, the strategic rationale for maintaining these bases has evolved rather than disappeared, particularly following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The geographic distribution of US forces reveals clear strategic priorities. Germany serves as the primary hub, hosting more than 35,000 troops across multiple installations. Ramstein Air Base, the largest US base outside American territory, functions as a crucial launch point for operations in the Middle East and Africa. Italy follows with approximately 12,375 personnel, while the United Kingdom hosts around 10,058. In total, American forces occupy roughly 50 bases with NATO access agreements across the continent.

Troop numbers have demonstrated significant variability in recent years. Congressional data indicates approximately 67,000 active-duty personnel across NATO member countries in 2024, representing roughly 40% of the estimated 170,000 US troops deployed globally. However, the Council on Foreign Relations reports higher figures since the Ukraine conflict began, with numbers fluctuating between 75,000 and 105,000 military personnel.

The article addresses the persistent tension regarding defense burden-sharing, a theme amplified by Donald Trump's characterizations of these bases as financially burdensome. In response to American pressure, NATO members committed in 2025 to increasing defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, a substantial escalation from previous targets.

France's conspicuous absence from hosting US bases merits particular attention. Charles de Gaulle's 1966 decision to expel American and Canadian military forces from French territory established a precedent that has endured. Even Nicolas Sarkozy's 2007 decision to reintegrate France into NATO's military command structure did not include provisions for returning American bases, maintaining France's unique position within the alliance.
