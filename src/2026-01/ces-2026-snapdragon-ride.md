## Synthesis

HERE Technologies and Qualcomm Technologies are demonstrating a significant advancement in automotive perception technology at CES 2026. Their collaboration integrates HERE's AI-powered mapping intelligence with Qualcomm's Snapdragon Ride Pilot system, creating what the companies describe as an "electronic horizon" that extends vehicle awareness far beyond what onboard sensors alone can achieve.

The core innovation addresses a fundamental limitation of sensor-based perception systems: they can only detect what they can physically see. Cameras, radar, and lidar are constrained by line-of-sight, weather conditions, and physical obstructions. By integrating high-definition map data as an additional perception layer, vehicles gain awareness of road conditions, geometry changes, and potential hazards long before they become visible to onboard sensors.

The Snapdragon Ride Pilot system leverages this electronic horizon to prepare for the road ahead, adjusting speed and trajectory before physical sensors detect changes. This predictive capability enables smoother, more comfortable driving experiences while enhancing safety. For example, the vehicle can begin preparing for a sharp curve or steep grade well in advance, making the transition feel natural rather than reactive.

Three major capabilities make this partnership particularly valuable for autonomous and advanced driver assistance systems. First, extended awareness through map layers creates perception beyond traditional line-of-sight limitations, effectively giving the vehicle knowledge of what lies around corners and over hills. Second, lane-level accuracy provides detailed road topology that enables smoother autonomous driving, with the vehicle understanding not just where roads go but the specific characteristics of each lane. Third, global readiness through HERE's ADAS map coverage, expanding to over 100 countries by 2026, ensures consistent capability across international markets.

The system also addresses critical regulatory compliance requirements. The European Union's Intelligent Speed Assistance mandate requires vehicles to know speed limits throughout their operating area—information that must come from map data rather than camera-based sign reading alone. Continuous over-the-air updates ensure vehicles maintain compliance with safety standards as regulations evolve and road conditions change.

This partnership exemplifies the growing recognition that autonomous driving systems require multiple, complementary sources of environmental understanding. While sensors provide real-time perception of immediate surroundings, AI-powered maps provide contextual knowledge that helps vehicles interpret sensor data more intelligently and plan maneuvers more effectively. As vehicles become increasingly automated, the fusion of sensor and map-based perception will be essential for safe, reliable operation.
