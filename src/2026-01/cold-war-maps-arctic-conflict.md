## Elevator pitch

A UCL cartography professor explores how Cold War-era maps commissioned by major American magazines shaped public understanding of geopolitics, and argues these historical visualizations offer crucial insights for understanding contemporary Arctic territorial disputes.

## Takeaways

- American magazines like Time, Life, and Fortune commissioned dramatic large-scale maps during the late 1940s and early 1950s to explain geopolitical tensions to mass audiences
- Cartographer Richard Edes Harrison pioneered the azimuthal equidistant projection for Arctic mapping, accurately representing distances from a center point while distorting country shapes
- Cold War maps emphasized the "air age" concept, showing how polar flight routes were faster than traditional maritime paths and transforming understanding of strategic geography
- Historical Cold War maps framed geopolitics through collective responsibility and alliances like NATO, contrasting with contemporary unilateralist approaches
- Modern digital maps using Mercator projections distort Greenland's size, potentially influencing contemporary perceptions of Arctic territories

## Synthesis

James Cheshire, Professor of Geographic Information and Cartography at UCL, examines the intersection of cartographic history and contemporary geopolitics through an analysis of Cold War-era maps. His article argues that these historical visualizations offer valuable perspective for understanding current Arctic territorial tensions, including renewed American interest in Greenland.

During the late 1940s and early 1950s, major American publications including Time, Life, and Fortune commissioned professional cartographers to create large-scale maps explaining emerging Cold War tensions to general audiences. Many of these cartographers had been trained during World War II, bringing sophisticated technical skills to the task of making complex geopolitical situations comprehensible. These maps were intended not merely as illustrations but as tools for public discussion and strategic thinking.

A central figure in this cartographic innovation was Richard Edes Harrison, who pioneered the use of azimuthal equidistant projections for Arctic mapping. Unlike the familiar Mercator projection, which preserves shapes but dramatically distorts sizes at high latitudes, the azimuthal equidistant projection accurately represents distances from a chosen center point while allowing shapes to become distorted. This technical choice carried profound conceptual implications, demonstrating what contemporaries called the "air age": the reality that commercial and military flights traversing polar routes could reach destinations faster than traditional maritime shipping paths.

The Cold War maps served a particular ideological function. Visualizations like the 1949 "Air Age Map of the Global Crisis" presented the conflict between communism and capitalism as competing ideologies contesting Arctic territories. These maps positioned readers as "global strategists," encouraging them to think in terms of collective responsibility through alliance structures like NATO rather than individual national dominance.

Cheshire draws a pointed contrast between this Cold War cartographic worldview and contemporary approaches. Modern digital mapping, dominated by the Mercator projection, creates significant distortions at high latitudes. Greenland appears far larger than its actual size relative to continental landmasses, potentially influencing how viewers perceive its strategic and resource value. More significantly, Cheshire argues that the collaborative framework embedded in Cold War maps stands in sharp contrast to contemporary "America First" unilateralism, suggesting that historical cartographic conventions reveal dimensions of geopolitical stakes that standardized digital representations obscure.
