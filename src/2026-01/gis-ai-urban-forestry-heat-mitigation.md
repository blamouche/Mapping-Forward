## Elevator pitch

Esri demonstrates how the combination of GIS technology and artificial intelligence is transforming urban forestry from aesthetic landscaping into a data-driven science for combating urban heat islands and delivering billions in ecosystem services.

## Takeaways

- Urban forestry has evolved from aesthetic landscaping to a science-driven cornerstone of city planning using advanced remote sensing, digital mapping, and data science
- Urban forests deliver quantifiable economic benefits: $5.4 billion in air pollution removal, $5.4 billion in reduced energy costs, and $2.7 billion in avoided emissions according to the US Forest Service
- GeoAI (geospatial artificial intelligence) combined with digital twins allows cities to model scenarios for population, forestry, and weather conditions
- Cities like Washington DC, Los Angeles, and Prague are using GIS mapping and predictive modeling to identify optimal tree planting locations for heat mitigation
- Heat risk indices help prioritize census tracts for tree planting interventions against urban heat islands

## Synthesis

Esri's exploration of GIS and AI applications in urban forestry highlights a fundamental shift in how cities approach tree management and urban heat mitigation. What was once primarily an aesthetic concern has transformed into a sophisticated, data-driven discipline with measurable impacts on public health, energy consumption, and environmental quality.

The integration of geospatial artificial intelligence, or GeoAI, represents a significant technological advancement for urban planning. By combining AI capabilities with geospatial data and digital twin technology, city planners can now model complex scenarios that account for population density, existing forest coverage, and various weather conditions. Azure AI's chat functionality, supported by large language models, enables users to interact directly with digital twins, posing specific questions about how urban environments might evolve over time under different conditions.

The economic case for urban forestry has become increasingly compelling through GIS-enabled measurement. According to US Forest Service data, urban forests across America provide ecosystem services valued in the billions: $5.4 billion in air pollution removal, $5.4 billion in reduced energy costs through natural cooling and insulation, and $2.7 billion in avoided emissions. Beyond these quantifiable benefits, trees sequester carbon, mitigate flooding through stormwater absorption, and support urban biodiversity.

Real-world implementations demonstrate the practical value of these technologies. Washington, DC has leveraged a decade of GIS mapping, analysis, and predictive modeling to direct its forest management strategy, identifying optimal planting locations and selecting appropriate tree species for each microenvironment. Los Angeles created the LA GeoHub using ArcGIS Hub technology to centralize city data, with a specific initiative to increase urban tree canopy in communities with minimal coverage to reduce heat island effects. Prague has similarly used GIS and satellite imagery to identify heat hotspots and pinpoint optimal locations for new vegetation.

Esri's heat resilience index tools provide a systematic methodology for cities to prioritize interventions. Using global collections of ready-to-use geographic information, planners can derive input variables to create intervention-focused maps. These visualizations enable local communities to prioritize specific census tracts for tree planting based on heat vulnerability, socioeconomic factors, and existing canopy coverage.

The convergence of remote sensing, digital mapping, data science, and artificial intelligence is creating unprecedented capabilities for urban heat mitigation, transforming trees from passive landscape elements into strategically deployed infrastructure for climate adaptation.
