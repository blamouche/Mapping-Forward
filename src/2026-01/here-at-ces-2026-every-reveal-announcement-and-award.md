## Synthesis

HERE Technologies made a significant impact at CES 2026, unveiling a series of partnerships and product integrations that underscore the company's central role in the evolution of automotive technology. The announcements paint a picture of an industry rapidly moving toward software-defined vehicles where location intelligence serves as the foundational layer connecting various automotive systems.

The expansion of HERE's partnership with Hyundai AutoEver represents a major milestone in bringing smartphone-like convenience to automotive navigation. By supporting over one million Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis vehicles with monthly over-the-air map updates, HERE is helping eliminate one of the traditional pain points of in-car navigation: outdated maps. The integration with HAE's ccNC and ccIC27 platforms delivers real-time location data alongside regular updates, reflecting the industry's broader shift toward treating vehicles as continuously evolving digital platforms rather than static products.

The Lucid Motors integration addresses one of the most persistent challenges in electric vehicle adoption: range anxiety. By incorporating HERE SDK into the Lucid Gravity and Air models, the system provides drivers with real-time isoline routing that shows actual achievable driving range based on current conditions. This goes beyond simple distance calculations to incorporate charging station locations directly into route planning, while also supporting advanced driver assistance features like adaptive cruise control.

Perhaps most forward-looking is HERE's collaboration with Qualcomm on the Snapdragon Ride Pilot platform. This partnership leverages AI-powered map intelligence to create what HERE calls an "e-horizon" - essentially extending a vehicle's awareness of road conditions well beyond what physical sensors like cameras and radar can detect. This capability is crucial for Level 2+ automated driving systems, providing the contextual road intelligence needed for safer and more capable autonomous features.

The integration with Amazon's Alexa Custom Assistant demonstrates HERE's recognition that the future of in-car interaction lies in natural language processing. Rather than forcing drivers to navigate complex menu systems, the conversational AI solution allows for intuitive requests like finding a restaurant with available parking nearby. This partnership combines HERE's mapping expertise with Amazon's voice AI capabilities to create a more seamless driving experience.

HERE's recognition as the top location platform in Omdia's 2025 Location Platform Index validates the company's strategic investments. Ranking ahead of major competitors including Google, TomTom, and Mapbox, HERE has positioned itself as the preferred partner for automotive OEMs seeking comprehensive location intelligence solutions. The diverse range of partnerships announced at CES 2026 - spanning traditional automakers, EV manufacturers, semiconductor companies, and tech giants - demonstrates the breadth of HERE's platform capabilities and its central role in shaping the future of mobility.
