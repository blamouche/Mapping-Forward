## Elevator pitch

This article maps the unprecedented Iranian uprising that began in late December 2025, tracing how economic grievances in Tehran's bazars spread geographically across the country and evolved into political demands for freedom.

## Takeaways

- The collapse of the toman and runaway inflation at the end of 2025 triggered the initial protests among Tehran's electronics and phone bazaar merchants on December 28
- Within 24 hours, protests shifted from economic grievances to political demands, with demonstrators chanting "Freedom!" and "Death to the dictator"
- By the third day, the movement had spread to major cities including Mashhad, Karaj, Yazd, Kermanshah, Shiraz, and Isfahan, particularly in their bazaars
- The impoverished lower middle class of city centers, hardest hit by inflation, formed the core of the movement
- This uprising achieved what no previous mobilization had since the establishment of the Islamic Republic: simultaneously engaging all societal strata

## Synthesis

Armin Messager, a doctoral student and journalist specializing in Iranian affairs, provides a geographic and sociological analysis of the uprising that shook Iran at the turn of 2025-2026. The article examines the structural economic factors and phases of mobilization that transformed localized commercial protests into a nationwide political movement.

The catalyst for the uprising was the dramatic collapse of the Iranian toman at the end of 2025. As prices soared and purchasing power evaporated, the electronics and telephone bazaar of Tehran found itself emptied of customers. These merchants became the first to act on December 28, 2025, lowering their shutters and descending into the bazaar's alleys to protest. This initial phase remained anchored in economic grievances directly affecting the commercial class.

The transformation came swiftly. By the afternoon of the second day, December 29, the contestation had spilled beyond the bazaar's confines into the streets of Tehran proper. Protest cortèges formed, and the nature of demands shifted dramatically. Demonstrators began chanting "Âzâdi!" (Freedom) and "Death to the dictator," signaling the transition from economic complaint to political opposition against the regime itself.

The third day marked the geographic diffusion of the movement across Iran's major urban centers. Mashhad, Karaj, Yazd, Kermanshah, Shiraz, and Isfahan all witnessed protests, with their bazaars serving as focal points. The lower middle class of city centers, most severely impacted by uncontrolled inflation, proved to be the movement's primary constituency in this expansion phase.

What distinguishes this uprising in Messager's analysis is its unprecedented ability to mobilize across societal divisions. Previous protests under the Islamic Republic had remained confined to specific social groups or geographic areas. This movement succeeded where others had failed: convening simultaneously all strata of Iranian society. The cartographic dimension of the article traces this spatial unfolding, demonstrating how urban commercial networks served as both the origin point and the conduit for protest diffusion.

The article situates these events within the longer trajectory of Iranian popular mobilization, drawing connections to previous protest waves while highlighting the unique characteristics that make this uprising historically significant. The intersection of acute economic crisis with accumulated political grievances created conditions for a movement that transcended the limitations of its predecessors.
