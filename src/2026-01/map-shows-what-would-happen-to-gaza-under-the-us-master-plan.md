## Elevator pitch

An interactive map analysis of Jared Kushner's Gaza reconstruction proposal reveals a plan that would erase historic neighborhoods and refugee camps to build luxury resorts, data centers, and gated communities without Palestinian consultation.

## Takeaways

- The Kushner plan was devised without any Palestinian input or consultation, raising fundamental questions about self-determination
- The proposal would eliminate historic sites including Gaza's Old City with structures over 1,000 years old, replacing them with industrial zones and data centers
- Multiple refugee camps including Shati, Jabalia, Nuseirat, and Maghazi would be demolished for coastal tourism and residential developments
- Urban planning experts characterize the scheme as "Vegas-ification" creating gated communities for specific economic classes rather than organic urban development
- The 2-3 year construction timeline provides no details on housing for displaced populations during that period

## Synthesis

Al Jazeera's interactive cartographic analysis examines the Gaza reconstruction plan unveiled by Jared Kushner at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2026. Through detailed mapping, the article illustrates the dramatic transformation proposed for the territory and the displacement of existing communities it would entail.

The plan envisions a comprehensive redevelopment featuring residential high-rise towers, data centers, seaside resorts, parks, sports facilities, and an airport. While presented as a development opportunity, urban design experts interviewed for the article characterize the approach as requiring the "total erasure of Gaza's existing urban fabric." Ali Alraouf, an urban design specialist, describes the concept as the "Vegas-ification" of Gaza, a model that prioritizes gated communities catering to specific economic classes over the organic development that characterizes authentic urban environments.

The cartographic analysis reveals the scope of displacement the plan would necessitate. Coastal areas including the Shati and Deir el-Balah refugee camps would be cleared for tourism development. Gaza's Old City, home to structures with over a millennium of history, would give way to industrial zones and data centers. Al-Shifa Hospital, the territory's primary medical facility, along with major universities, would be demolished for coastal tourism infrastructure. Historic agricultural lands in Beit Lahiya would become manufacturing zones, while the Jabalia, Maghazi, and Nuseirat refugee camps would be replaced by parks and new residential developments.

The political dimensions of the proposal have drawn sharp criticism from analysts. The plan contains no mention of Israeli military withdrawal, Palestinian property rights, or the question of Palestinian statehood. Sultan Barakat, a regional analyst, warns that the proposal represents a continuation rather than a conclusion of displacement policies, noting that "the whole idea of displacing Palestinians, pushing them out from Gaza, has not ended."

Technical experts have raised practical concerns about the plan's feasibility. Engineering specialists dismiss the proposal as "real estate fantasy rather than urban planning," pointing to the significant structural challenges of constructing high-rise buildings on terrain covered with debris from the conflict. The projected 2-3 year construction timeline provides no details on where displaced populations would live during this period, a humanitarian gap that undermines the plan's viability.

The article's interactive map serves as a powerful tool for understanding the geographic and human implications of the proposal, transforming abstract policy discussions into visible spatial realities.
