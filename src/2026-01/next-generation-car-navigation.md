## Elevator pitch

HERE Technologies argues that vehicle-integrated navigation systems accessing sensor data will surpass smartphone apps, marking the end of phone-based navigation dominance.

## Takeaways

- Dashboard navigation systems can access vehicle sensor data that smartphones cannot
- HERE UniMap provides a unified mapping system with physical changes visible within 24 hours
- Vehicle sensors like windshield wipers and traction control provide real-time road condition data
- Electric vehicles benefit from precise range calculations using hill grades and temperature data
- Autonomous systems require high-definition lane-specific maps that function in adverse conditions

## Synthesis

HERE Technologies is making a bold prediction about the future of automotive navigation: the era of smartphone-based mapping applications dominating in-car navigation is coming to an end. The company argues that vehicle-integrated navigation systems offer fundamental advantages that smartphone apps simply cannot match, rooted in their access to the car's sensor ecosystem.

The core argument centers on data sources. While popular smartphone navigation apps like Google Maps or Waze infer traffic patterns and road conditions from the movement of mobile devices, dashboard-integrated systems can tap directly into a vehicle's extensive sensor array. This includes windshield wipers detecting rain intensity, traction control systems sensing icy conditions, and onboard cameras identifying road closures or construction zones in real time.

HERE UniMap represents the company's vision for this next-generation navigation infrastructure. This unified mapping platform consolidates data from multiple sources into a single, semantically-aligned environment where changes to physical road conditions become visible within 24 hours. This rapid update cycle ensures that navigation systems reflect current reality rather than outdated map data.

The implications for electric vehicles are particularly significant. Range anxiety remains a major concern for EV drivers, and smartphone navigation apps provide only rough estimates based on general terrain data. Vehicle-integrated systems can calculate range with much greater precision by incorporating exact hill grades along the planned route, current and forecasted temperatures affecting battery performance, and real-time driving style analysis. This level of detail is impossible for phone apps that lack access to the vehicle's internal systems.

For autonomous and advanced driver assistance systems, the requirements are even more demanding. These systems need high-definition, lane-specific maps that maintain accuracy even when cameras fail due to snow, heavy rain, or other adverse conditions. HERE's approach combines map data with sensor fusion to create a navigation foundation that can support everything from basic turn-by-turn directions to full self-driving capabilities.

The competitive dynamics in the navigation space are shifting accordingly. While smartphone apps disrupted traditional automotive navigation by offering free, frequently-updated alternatives, HERE argues that the pendulum is swinging back toward integrated solutions. The future of navigation, according to HERE, is native to the vehicle, intelligent in its use of sensor data, and deeply integrated with the car's operating systems. As vehicles become more connected and autonomous capabilities expand, the limitations of phone-based navigation will become increasingly apparent, driving adoption of more sophisticated integrated solutions.
