## Elevator pitch

HERE Technologies and Omdia introduce a four-phase maturity framework helping automakers understand their evolution from traditional hardware manufacturers to mobility technology companies.

## Takeaways

- The SDV maturity framework defines four phases: Connected, Augmented, Adaptive, and Agentic
- Phase 1 (Connected) involves over-the-air updates but factory-locked core capabilities
- Phase 2 (Augmented) enables post-purchase feature additions like enhanced navigation
- Phase 3 (Adaptive) uses edge AI for vehicles that learn user patterns and respond contextually
- Phase 4 (Agentic) transforms vehicles into intelligent agents integrated with IoT and smart cities
- Progression requires aligned technology and business model evolution

## Synthesis

HERE Technologies, in collaboration with research firm Omdia, has developed a comprehensive maturity framework to help automakers understand their journey toward becoming software-defined vehicle (SDV) manufacturers. This framework recognizes that the transformation involves not just technological advancement but fundamental changes in business models and organizational capabilities.

The framework defines four distinct phases of SDV evolution. In Phase 1, Connected, vehicles function as internet-connected devices that can receive over-the-air updates. However, core driving capabilities remain factory-locked, meaning the fundamental vehicle behavior cannot be changed after purchase. During this phase, automakers continue to operate primarily as traditional hardware manufacturers, with software playing a supporting rather than defining role.

Phase 2, Augmented, represents a significant shift where cars begin acquiring new capabilities after purchase. Customers can access enhanced navigation systems, superior voice command interfaces, and richer infotainment experiences through software updates. Manufacturers start transitioning toward software orchestration, though the updates focus on supplementary features rather than core driving systems. This phase requires automakers to develop competencies in software delivery and customer lifecycle management that differ from traditional automotive manufacturing.

Phase 3, Adaptive, introduces advanced electrical and electronic architectures that enable vehicles to learn user patterns and respond intelligently. Edge AI allows contextual adjustments—the vehicle might automatically activate navigation when detecting a typical commute pattern or suggest autonomous features when appropriate conditions are detected. Reaching this phase requires automakers to develop software company expertise in artificial intelligence, analytics, and cloud computing. The organizational transformation at this stage is substantial, requiring new talent, development methodologies, and operational practices.

Phase 4, Agentic, represents the ultimate evolution where vehicles become intelligent agents fully integrated into users' digital ecosystems. The car anticipates needs through IoT connectivity and smart city integration, enabling services that transcend traditional automotive boundaries. At this phase, automakers have effectively evolved into mobility technology companies, with the physical vehicle serving as one component of a broader service offering.

The framework acknowledges that different manufacturers will navigate this journey differently. Greenfield OEMs in emerging markets may bypass early phases entirely, designing vehicles from the ground up around software-defined principles. Established manufacturers typically begin at Phase 1, facing organizational and cultural transformation challenges alongside technical ones. Success requires aligning technology investments with business model evolution, ensuring that each phase builds sustainable competitive advantage while preparing for the next.
