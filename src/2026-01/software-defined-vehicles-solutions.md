## Synthesis

HERE Technologies made a significant announcement at CES 2026, unveiling a comprehensive portfolio of solutions designed to address one of the automotive industry's most pressing challenges: the fragmented architectures that complicate software-defined vehicle development. The solutions aim to unify location intelligence across navigation, driver assistance, and autonomy domains.

The core problem HERE addresses is what CPO Denise Doyle describes as "Frankenstein" vehicle architectures. Currently, many automakers operate with navigation systems that are entirely separate from the data controlling advanced driver assistance features like lane-keeping. This fragmentation creates unnecessary complexity, increases development costs, and makes it difficult to deliver cohesive user experiences across different vehicle functions.

HERE Navigation v10 forms the foundation of the new portfolio, offering a flexible SDK that allows automakers to create customized navigation experiences while maintaining consistency with other vehicle systems. The accompanying AI-powered voice assistant simplifies user interactions, enabling drivers to access complex functionality through natural language commands rather than navigating through multiple menus.

One of the most innovative solutions introduced is Behavioral Maneuvers, launching in early 2026. This capability draws on millions of miles of real-world driving data to enable autonomous vehicles to behave more naturally and predictably. Rather than the robotic, jerky movements that characterize many current autonomous systems, Behavioral Maneuvers helps vehicles drive in ways that feel trustworthy and comfortable to passengers and other road users.

SceneXtract represents a breakthrough in autonomous vehicle testing. This AI tool can generate comprehensive test scenarios in minutes rather than the weeks traditionally required. Efficient scenario generation is critical for autonomous vehicle development, where systems must be validated across countless edge cases before deployment. By dramatically accelerating this process, SceneXtract helps automakers iterate more quickly while maintaining safety standards.

Automated Driving Zones provide precise geographic controls for determining when and where specific autonomous features can be activated. This geofencing capability is essential as automakers roll out autonomy features that may only be approved for certain road types or jurisdictions. The unified approach ensures consistent, accurate zone definitions across all vehicle systems.

The business impact of HERE's unified portfolio is substantial. By integrating location intelligence across domains, automakers can reduce development costs, eliminate redundant systems, and accelerate timelines by up to 70%. As the industry races toward software-defined architectures, solutions that simplify complexity while enabling innovation will be increasingly valuable.
