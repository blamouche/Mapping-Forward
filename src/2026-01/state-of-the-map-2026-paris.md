## Synthesis

The announcement that State of the Map 2026 will be held in Paris represents a significant moment for the European OpenStreetMap community and positions France as a focal point for open geographic data discussions in the coming year. Following the 2025 edition in Manila, the conference returns to Europe for its 18th iteration, scheduled for August 28-30, 2026.

The choice of venue reflects the strong institutional support for the event. Geodata Paris, formerly known as ENSG (Ecole Nationale des Sciences Geographiques), is an engineering school directly affiliated with France's National Geographic Institute (IGN). This connection to the country's official mapping authority underscores the growing relationship between traditional geographic institutions and the open mapping community. The venue choice signals that OpenStreetMap has matured from a grassroots project into a recognized component of the broader geospatial ecosystem.

The organizational structure demonstrates the collaborative nature of the OSM community. OpenStreetMap France's association is leading the effort alongside an impressive consortium of partners including ENPC (Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussees), Gustave Eiffel University, IGN, and Geodata Paris. This multi-institutional approach ensures the conference benefits from academic, governmental, and community perspectives.

State of the Map has always served as a bridge between different constituencies within the mapping world, and the Paris edition promises to continue this tradition. The event welcomes participants across a wide spectrum: experienced contributors who have been mapping for years, curious newcomers exploring OpenStreetMap for the first time, and industry professionals seeking to understand or leverage OSM data. Past conferences have attracted representatives from major organizations spanning the institutional sector (ESRI, IGN) and mobility companies (SNCF), demonstrating OpenStreetMap's relevance across commercial and public sector applications.

The conference program typically encompasses diverse interests, from nature enthusiasts and hiking advocates who use and contribute to OSM for outdoor activities, to professional geographic data specialists working on large-scale data infrastructure. This diversity is one of State of the Map's defining characteristics, creating unique opportunities for knowledge exchange between volunteers and professionals that would not occur in purely commercial or purely community settings.

For those interested in contributing to the event's success, the OpenStreetMap France community has opened organizational discussions through their dedicated forum. This participatory approach to conference planning reflects the broader OSM ethos of community-driven development. The official event website at 2026.stateofthemap.org will serve as the central resource for registration, program announcements, and logistical information as the conference approaches.
