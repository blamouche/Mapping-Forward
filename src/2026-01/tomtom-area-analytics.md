## Elevator pitch

TomTom Area Analytics is a traffic intelligence platform that enables governments, consultants, and analysts to examine custom geographic areas using comprehensive traffic metrics including congestion levels, travel speeds, and travel times, with flexible data export options for integration into existing workflows.

## Takeaways

- Area Analytics allows users to define custom geographic boundaries and timeframes for traffic analysis using TomTom's market-leading traffic data
- The platform provides comprehensive metrics including congestion levels, travel speeds, free-flow speeds, and travel times organized by hour, day, or date range
- Data visualization features include interactive maps with customizable layers to display traffic patterns
- Export capabilities support CSV and GeoJSON formats for integration with external systems and analysis tools
- Primary use cases span government urban planning, traffic consulting, financial analysis, and media content creation

## Synthesis

TomTom's Area Analytics represents the company's offering in the traffic intelligence and location analytics market, providing a self-service platform for analyzing traffic patterns within user-defined geographic areas. The product targets professional users who need detailed traffic insights without requiring custom data science infrastructure or direct API integration.

The core value proposition centers on accessibility and flexibility. Users can select custom geographic areas rather than being constrained to predefined administrative boundaries, and they can specify precise timeframes for analysis. This combination allows for targeted investigation of specific corridors, neighborhoods, or regions during periods of interest. The underlying data comes from TomTom's traffic data assets, which the company positions as market-leading based on its decades of experience in navigation and traffic information services.

The metrics provided are fundamental to traffic engineering and urban planning: congestion levels quantify how traffic conditions compare to ideal free-flow states, travel speeds show actual observed vehicle velocities, free-flow speeds establish baseline uncongested conditions, and travel times translate these measurements into practical journey duration estimates. The organization of data by hour, day, or date range supports both operational analysis of daily patterns and strategic assessment of longer-term trends.

Data visualization through interactive maps with customizable layers allows users to explore patterns spatially, identifying problem areas or validating hypotheses about traffic behavior. For users who need to incorporate findings into their own systems or perform advanced analysis, the platform supports export in CSV format for spreadsheet and database compatibility, as well as GeoJSON for geographic information system integration.

TomTom identifies four primary user segments for Area Analytics. Government and city agencies can leverage the platform for urban planning decisions, infrastructure investment prioritization, and policy evaluation by measuring before-and-after impacts of interventions. Traffic consultants gain a tool for precise analyses and validation of traffic management strategies without building custom data pipelines. Financial analysts represent a perhaps unexpected but logical audience, as traffic patterns serve as economic indicators for retail location assessment, real estate valuation, and supply chain analysis. Media companies round out the target market, using traffic intelligence for content creation and transportation policy impact reporting.

The product is available through TomTom's MOVE platform with a 30-day free trial, lowering the barrier to evaluation. Geographic coverage is global, though specific country availability may vary. This positioning reflects TomTom's broader strategy of democratizing access to location intelligence that was previously available only to large enterprises with dedicated geospatial teams.
