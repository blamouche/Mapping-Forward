## Elevator pitch

TomTom's 15th annual Traffic Index provides a comprehensive global analysis of urban traffic congestion, revealing that keeping traffic moving has never been more challenging as cities continue to grow and mobility patterns evolve.

## Takeaways

- The District of Columbia leads U.S. congestion rankings with a 42% congestion level, followed by Hawaii at 32% and New York at 28%
- The index monitors hundreds of major cities worldwide with minute-by-minute traffic observations compiled into annual overviews
- Rush hour impact analysis reveals dramatic differences in travel distances, with Mexico City drivers able to cover only 3.4 km during peak hours versus 7.3 km in optimal conditions
- New York City showed no change in average congestion levels between 2024 and 2025, suggesting stable but persistent traffic challenges
- The platform enables multi-level geographic analysis from global to neighborhood scale, allowing users to identify localized congestion patterns

## Synthesis

The TomTom Traffic Index represents one of the most comprehensive annual assessments of global urban traffic conditions, now in its 15th edition. This data-driven platform aggregates millions of traffic observations across hundreds of cities worldwide, transforming raw movement data into actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and the general public.

The 2025 edition reinforces a sobering reality for urban mobility: managing traffic flow has become increasingly difficult as metropolitan areas expand and vehicle usage intensifies. The index provides granular measurements of congestion levels, average speeds, distance traveled in 15-minute intervals, and highway trip ratios, painting a detailed picture of how people move through cities at different times of day.

In the United States, the rankings reveal significant regional disparities in traffic conditions. The District of Columbia emerges as the most congested area with a 42% congestion level, reflecting the intense traffic pressures in the nation's capital where government workers, tourists, and residents compete for limited road space. Hawaii follows at 32%, likely influenced by geographic constraints and tourism-driven traffic on limited road networks. New York State ranks fourth nationally at 28%, with New York City identified as the most congested municipality within the state.

The index's rush hour analysis provides particularly striking insights into urban mobility challenges. The comparison between optimal and peak-hour travel distances illustrates how severely congestion impacts daily commutes. In Mexico City, drivers can theoretically cover 7.3 kilometers in a given time under ideal conditions, but this drops to just 3.4 kilometers during rush hour, representing a more than 50% reduction in effective travel distance. Similar patterns emerge across major global cities including London, Paris, Mumbai, Jakarta, and New York.

A notable finding from the 2025 data is the stability of New York City's congestion levels, which showed no change compared to 2024. This plateau could indicate that the city's traffic management strategies are holding steady against increasing pressures, or alternatively, that congestion has reached a saturation point where road networks simply cannot accommodate additional vehicles.

The Traffic Index serves multiple audiences with its flexible geographic filtering capabilities. Users can analyze data at the world, continent, state, or city level, and can toggle between all-time averages, morning rush hour, and evening rush hour metrics. This flexibility makes the tool valuable for transportation agencies conducting strategic planning, businesses optimizing logistics operations, and researchers studying urban mobility trends.

TomTom positions this index as evidence of the critical importance of data in addressing modern transportation challenges. The company argues that comprehensive, real-time traffic data is essential for cities seeking to improve mobility, reduce emissions associated with idling vehicles, and enhance quality of life for residents navigating increasingly crowded streets.
